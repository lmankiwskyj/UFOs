# UFOs

## Overview 
A new webpage has been created to provide users with an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

Using JavaScript and Bootstrap, the webpage allows users to filter by multiple input options at the same time. 

## Results
With dynamic and interactive filters, users can input specific criteria to search by date, city, state, country, and/or shape.
  - Step #1:  Type criteria into one or all the filter options
  - Step #2:  Click the filter button
  - Step #3:  The filtered results are displayed

While the site seems straight forward, there were three different sets of code needed to create this!

  - JavaScript (app.js) to put the data into a table and create interactive user filters
  - HTML (index.html) to display the information in a web browser
  - Bootstrap (style.css) to style and format the webpage

## Summary
The one limit of the current webpage is that there is no clear filter button to easily allow for multiple searches. A future enhancement would be to add a clear filter button and a way for the user to save or print the information found from using the filter criteria.
